# Random Learning WebDev 🌱

My personal sandbox for learning web development — a collection of small HTML/CSS/JS exercises I've built while studying IT/Computer Science, plus one bigger prototype tied to my thesis work.

This isn't a polished product repo. It's closer to a lab notebook: each file (or small file group) is one concept I wanted to understand by actually building it, rather than just reading about it.

## 🎯 Why this repo exists

As a student, I wanted a place to:
- Practice core HTML/CSS/JS concepts outside of class assignments
- Try out UI patterns and effects I see online and figure out how they work
- Keep a visible record of how my skills have progressed over time
- Build toward bigger, more "real" projects (like the café POS prototype below)

## 🗂️ What's in here

### UI Components & Interactions
Small, focused exercises on common interface patterns.

| Exercise | Files | Concept practiced |

| Floating Input Animation | `Floating Input Ani.html/css` | Animated form labels |
| OTP UI | `OTP-UI.html/css/js` | One-time-password style input boxes |
| Upload System | `Upload System.html/css`, `Upload system.js` | File upload UI/logic |
| Password Generator | `Password Generator.html/css` | Randomized string generation |
| Smooth Animated NavBar | `Smooth Ani NavBar.html/css` | Navigation bar animation |
| Nav (TSX) | `Nav.tsx` | Navigation component in a React/TS context |

### Visual Effects & Animation
Exercises focused on CSS/JS-driven visuals.

| Exercise | Files | Concept practiced |
|---|---|---|
| Animated Background | `Animated BG.html/css` | Background animation |
| Animated Progress Bar | `Animated Progress bar.html/css` | Progress indicators |
| Gradient Background | `Gradrient Background.html/css` | CSS gradients |
| GlassMorphism | `GlassMorphism.html/css/js` | Frosted-glass UI style |

| GSAP Cursor Trail | `GSAP cursor trail.html/css/js` | Using the GSAP animation library |
| Overlapping Scroll | `OverlappingScroll.css`, `OverlappingScroll copy.html` | Scroll-based layout effects |
| Box | `Box.html/css` | Layout/box model practice |

### Logic & Data Handling
Exercises focused more on JavaScript logic than visuals.

| Exercise | Files | Concept practiced |
|---|---|---|
| Dark Mode + Local Storage | `DarkMode and Local Storage.html/css/js` | Theme toggling + persisting state with `localStorage` |
| Color | `Color.html/css/js` | Color manipulation/generation |
| QR Code | `QR Code.html/js` | Generating QR codes with JS |
| Realtime | `Realtime.html/css/js` | Real-time updating UI |

### Misc / Reference
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Html shortcuts.html` | Personal reference notes for HTML shortcuts |
| `Test Exercises 2hrs random codes.html` | Timed practice session |
| `Testing.css`, `test.html` | Scratch files for quick testing |
| `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js` | Base scaffold files |

### 🏆 Featured Project: Café POS System Prototype
**`houtarou_pos.html`** — a single-file Point-of-Sale prototype for a café, built as part of my thesis exploration (*POS and Inventory Management System for Beanne's Café*). It includes:
- A themed menu with categories and pricing (PHP currency)
- A working cart with live totals and 12% VAT calculation
- Receipt generation
- A custom warm, minimalist café aesthetic (Playfair Display + Inter fonts)
- A login screen (demo credentials only — **not** production-ready)

This is the most "complete" piece in the repo and represents where my smaller exercises above are heading: real, usable interfaces rather than isolated demos.

## 📈 Progress notes

- Started with basic HTML/CSS layout and hover effects
- Moved into JavaScript-driven interactivity (local storage, real-time updates, file uploads)
- Started incorporating external libraries (GSAP) and typed component syntax (TSX)
- Currently applying these skills toward a larger, thesis-related prototype (café POS system)

## ⚠️ Notes

- These are learning exercises, not production code — expect hardcoded demo values, inline styles/scripts, and no build tooling.
- `houtarou_pos.html` uses hardcoded demo login credentials for prototyping only.
- Most exercises can be run by simply opening the `.html` file in a browser.

## 🔮 Next steps

- [ ] Add a proper README-style comment header to each exercise file
- [ ] Split `houtarou_pos.html` into separate CSS/JS files
- [ ] Standardize file naming (remove spaces, use kebab-case)
- [ ] Continue building out the POS/Inventory system as part of thesis work
